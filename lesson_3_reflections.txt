When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would do this when colaborating with other people or when changing the work computer often.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Becasue the changes made can be removed easily locally, also, only the logical changes to be updated.
