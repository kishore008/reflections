When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would do this when colaborating with other people or when changing the work computer often.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Becasue the changes made can be removed easily locally, also, only the logical changes to be updated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is only used on github to copy/clone a repository which we don't have edit persmissions for.
Clone is to clone is repository from github to local machine, or from local directory to another directory.
Branches are used when we don't want to change the working code, which may break the program, branches are good way to experiment or add a new feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So, any futher changes can be done locally and the commits by others can be synched.
