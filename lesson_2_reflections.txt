What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The repository is createed when you run the "git init" command, this is needed to start the repository.
There is no commit, this should be done manually.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area gives more control to the user and the user can choose which files to be added to the commit and commit the fies at once, instead of doing the commit for each file.
